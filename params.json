But I've been still using memorable passwords which I thought were safe enough. I used a pattern like &lt;mysecretword&gt;&lt;site_name&gt; etc for most websites I log in to. But I've involved in a kinda research project (in which the system prepares a dictionary of passwords targeting a single user by gathering information about her from her social accounts), and discovered that someone with access to my social accounts (although I don't have many) can easily guess those passwords.   \r\nSo here is a quick password generator (quick in the sense that it took me very less time building it)  \r\n\r\n## How it work\r\nThis script receives a password from command line, convert it into sha512 hash, and mingle some characters to increase the complexity of the password.\r\nIt convert some special character on even places with symbols etc. (Read the code, it's simple. Really.)  \r\nSo the result is a long string which can be used as password on real sites.  \r\n\r\n## How to use\r\nPreferred way of using it is to \r\n* give it different password for every site, which you can remember\r\n* generate a password using the script\r\n* copy-paste for login to the site\r\n* regenerate when needed again in future with same password as given in step1\r\n\r\n### Recommended way choosing passwords for input\r\nUse an easy to remember pattern which would be different for different sites. e.g\r\n>     blueFacebookPants  \r\n>     greenGooglePants  \r\n>     orangeStumbleuponPants  \r\n\r\n## firewor.py\r\nPython script for standalone use.\r\n> Usage: python fireword.py <myFacyPassword> [length]\r\n\r\n## fireword.js\r\nJavascript port of fireword.py. Depends on [jsSHA](http://caligatio.github.io/jsSHA/) for generating SHA512 hash of input.\r\n\r\n## Firefox Extension\r\nFirefox extension is available at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fireword-gen/\r\n\r\n## Chrome Extension\r\nI din't want to pay $5 for chrome developer account. So you can download packaged chrome extension from here https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/35062882/chrome.crx  \r\n  \r\nYou can always build from source in ./browser_extensions/chrome. \r\n","google":"UA-47724380-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
