Fireword password generator for Firefox. Generate safe password from right within the Firefox. Give Fireword a simple easy to remember (but fairly unique) pattern for each site like MyBlueFacebook and get a completely different and strong password.  

Fireword is a simple and open source password generator.

## Preferred way of using it is to
* give it different password for every site, which you can remember
* generate a password using the addon
* copy-paste for login to the site
* regenerate when needed again in future with same password as given in step1

## Recommended way choosing passwords for input
* Use an easy to remember pattern which would be different for different sites. e.g
* blueFacebookPants 
* greenGooglePants 
* orangeStumbleuponPants

##Why was Fireword Gen created?
I was doing a research project lately on cracking passwords and found my own passwords very weak and easy to crack. So I needed a system to harden my passwords, but I didn't want to use a third party system which would require a master password or which would store my passwords on their server.  
  
So I made Fireword, which generates unique passwords using an easy to use pattern. So I can create different and very strong passwords for different websites, and so can remember all my passwords, and still they are very strong.  
  
Besides this, if I need to login to my accounts from computers other than mine, I can access Fireword web app and generate my password there. I've also made a Python script which has no dependencies and generate passwords locally on any computer with Python installed.  
  
## What's next for Fireword Gen
I am thinking about making it able to generate password right inside the password field of a login box i.e. you'll just type your simple password in the login box, press a keyboard shortcut, and password will be generated right there. I was also thinking about making it optional to use special characters, and also to make password generation through hashing optional so you could just do F@c3b0Ok for Facebook instead of 126A47c8|Fe{~T>0*:9133WXE{1.  
  
But I am yet to find a website which limits me from using special characters as passwords, so I am procrastinating. I will develop it if someone else need it (and they tell me).
