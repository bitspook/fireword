Fireword password generator for Firefox. Generate safe password from right within the Firefox. Give Fireword a simple easy to remember (but fairly unique) pattern for each site like MyBlueFacebook and get a completely different and strong password.  

Fireword is a simple and open source password generator.

## Preferred way of using it is to
* give it different password for every site, which you can remember
* generate a password using the addon
* copy-paste for login to the site
* regenerate when needed again in future with same password as given in step1

## Recommended way choosing passwords for input
* Use an easy to remember pattern which would be different for different sites. e.g
* blueFacebookPants 
* greenGooglePants 
* orangeStumbleuponPants
